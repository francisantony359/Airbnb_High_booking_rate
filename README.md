Predicting if a Listing will have High booking rate
Team Project as part of the course Data Mining and Predictive Analytics 

The analysis began with getting rid of all the data inconsistencies, errors and null values. The modeling approaches included using the available features for models, creating interaction variables from highly correlated features and adding features to the dataset to enhance the predictions based on related information.

The data was split up into 75% training data and 25% validation data. The team started with the most basic model which was logistic regression and followed it up with Bagged Adaboost, Bagged CART, Random Forest and Bayesian Generalized Linear Model. The Random Forest algorithm proved to provide the highest accuracy. 


Algorithm .                  Accuracy
Logistic Regression           82.79%
Gradient Boosting             82.37%
Bagged AdaBoost               76.98%
Bagged Cart                   81.91%
Cart                          77.93%
Parallel Random Forest        82.4%
Bayesian Generalized linear   78.07%
Random Forest                 84.37%
